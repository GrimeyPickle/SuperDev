### Privacy Note
* It Does Not Collect Any Data at All and is Fully Offline Except for Two Fetch Requests.

### About Export Element
* It Removes All ```Unused CSS``` From the Exported Element, So Only Used CSS Will Be Included in the Results.
* It Converts All Relative Urls to Absolute, It Means All ```href```, ```src```, ```srcset``` or CSS ```url()``` Will Work Perfectly After Export.
* It Works Perfectly Well With ```@media```, ```@font-face```, ```@supports```, ```@imports``` and ```@keyframes``` and Retains Only the Used Ones.
* It Works Perfectly Well With CSS ```vars()```, and Converts CSS Variable Values to Actual Value.
* It Removes Comments From CSS, Add Browser Prefixes Such as ```-moz```, ```-webkit``` Wherever Necessary.
* It Removes Overridden, Discarded, Unused CSS Rules Completely.
* It Converts to Shorthands Wherever Necessary and Formats Everything Before Export.
* It's Algorithm (500+ Lines) is Second to None Except CSS Scan's (Paid) That Too With a Negligible 5-10% Difference in Precision.

### Install On
* [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superdev/jlkikimlceonbmfjieipbonnglnlchhl) - Working Perfectly
* [Microsoft Edge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superdev/jlkikimlceonbmfjieipbonnglnlchhl) - Working Perfectly
* [Brave Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superdev/jlkikimlceonbmfjieipbonnglnlchhl) - Working Perfectly

### Built With
* ```ReactJS``` - Used by Superdev Popup
* ```TailWindCSS``` - Used by Superdev Popup
* ```PostCSS``` - Used by Export Element
* ```JSBeautify``` - Used by Export Element

### Troubleshooting
* This is a Very Active Project, and Bug Reports Are Most Welcome.
* If It's Not Working on a Site, Try Turning It Off and/or Refreshing the Page.
* If It's Still Not Working, Uninstall and Reinstall the Extension.
* Make Sure You're Running the Latest Version of Superdev + the Browser.
* If None of This Work, Submit an Issue [Here](Https://github.com/twoabd/superdev/issues/new).

### Important Note
* ```Page Ruler``` and ```Color Picker``` Both Takes Page Screenshots, Process That Image to Find the Distance Between Two Objects and the Color of That Area. It Means It Won't Work Properly on Sliders and Moving Elements of the Page.
* ```Export to Codepen``` Functionality of Export Element Features Won't Work on Some Super Secure Sites Because of CSP (Form Action) Header, Save to File Instead in That Case. Due to Issues in Chrome Api MV3, CSP Header Can't Be Modified Programmatically, and Disabling CSP Will Be a Major Security Risk, That's Why I Am Leaving It as It is.
* ```Export Element``` Feature Currently Disables CORS on All Fonts, Images, and Media Files Across All Websites. This is to Ensure All Fonts, Images, and Media Files Load Correctly on Codepen and Exported Files on the User's Device. However, I Still Need to Figure Out Whether to Retain This Feature or Remove It.
* ```Superdev``` is Saving You and Your Team a Good Amount of Time and Effort? [Buy Me a Coffee](Https://www.buymeacoffee.com/abdollah) â˜•

### Troubleshooting
* Bug Reports Are Most Welcome.

* Make Sure You're Running The Latest Version of SuperDev + The Browser.
* If None of This Work, Submit An Issue [Here](https://github.com/twoabd/SuperDev/issues/new).

### Important Note
* ```Page Ruler``` and ```Color Picker``` Both Takes Page Screenshots, Process That Image to Find the Distance Between Two Objects and The Color of That Area. It Means It Won't Work Properly on Sliders and Moving Elements of The Page.
* ```Export to Codepen``` Functionality of Export Element Features Won't Work on Some Super Secure Sites Because of CSP (Form Action) Header, Save to File Instead in That Case. Due to Issues in Chrome API MV3, CSP Header Can't Be Modified Programmatically, and Disabling CSP Will Be A Major Security Risk, That's Why I Am Leaving It As It Is.
* ```Export Element``` Feature Currently Disables CORS on All Fonts, Images, and Media Files Across All Websites. This Is To Ensure All Fonts, Images, and Media Files Load Correctly on Codepen and Exported Files on The User's Device. However, I Still Need to Figure Out Whether to Retain This Feature or Remove It.
